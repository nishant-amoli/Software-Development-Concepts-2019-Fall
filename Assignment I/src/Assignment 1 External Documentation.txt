
Overview
--------

This program allows the user to read  the structured data from
a flat file and allow them to perform transformation operations
onto the data after storing it into an object.

The functionalities of this program include:

- Reading data from a text file
- Perform the following manupulation on the data, in any order:
  * Create new columns and add them to the object
  * Change column's data values corresponding to restricted froms of equations
  * Show the data inside of the object
  * Clear the data from the object
  * Show the top five columns
  * Write the object into a file

Data Structure
--------------

The program, after reading the data from the file stores it into a hash map where
each row is parsed and the columns are stored in an array list as the value of
the hash map and the key is the integer value starting from 0 to the total number
of rows present in the file. Each value inside of the hash map is in the form of 
string.

Method Description
------------------

Read -- Takes the file path in the form of a string as an arguement and returns
        an integer value that is the number of rows present in the file at that
	instance of time.
Clear -- When invoked, empties the hash map object. The method returns true if
	 the object is successfully cleared, otherwise false.
NewColumn -- This method creates a new column and add it to the class object. The
	     rest of the row underneath the new column is assigned the character '0'.
	     Column names are unique and can not be null or left blank and so if the
	     method is invoked with null or blank space or a string that has the same
	     value as the name of pre existing columns in the object, the method will
	     return false. Otherwise, it will return true.
Calculate -- This method can be called along with a restricted form of equation containing
	     either two operands separated by an operator (just +, -, *, /). The operands
	     can be either the name of the columns or a constant value. It returns an integer
	     value that is the number of rows affected by operation.
Top -- Print the top five rows present in the object including one row containing column names
       four data rows.
Print -- Print the entire object onto the screen.

Assumptions
-----------

- There will be atmost 10 columns in the input file.
- The full path of the file will be given in the form of a string.
- Number of characters in one line is less than 80.
- Column names will not contain any special symbols or a space character.

Restrictions
------------
- The equation will always be in the form of "value = value + operator + value". There will
  always be a space between them.
- Column names are case insensentive.
